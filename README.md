It's a reinforcement learning algorithm used to identify how many users like the advertisements created for a juice company. A total of 10 ads have been prepared, and 10,000 rounds will be executed. The main objective is to find which advertisement is most liked by users. It's the best algorithm to predict the best result, even with 500 rounds. It is better than the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm.
